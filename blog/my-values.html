    <h1>My Values</h1>
    <p>
      I would say the most relevant ethical decision I’ve made recently is the
      decision to move back to Auckland after living in Wellington for 2 years.
      This was a very tough decision for me to make as I had just started
      developing deeper connections with all the friends I had made down there.
      One of the main reasons that I moved back up was to start up my old band
      again with my best friend Mina. In Wellington, despite my efforts, I
      didn’t have the same opportunities to pursue my creative endeavours, both
      in film and music. I was aware that relocating from Wellington would
      deeply sadden a couple of my friends, but in the end I did what was best
      for me, knowing that I could always visit them, if not move back down at
      some point later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I am here, I’ve been making music far more frequently and I feel
      like I’m finally getting to be creative again. It’s also been very nice to
      see my family again, along with a few of my high school friends that I
      haven’t seen in a long time. Looking back on this decision
      retrospectively, I can identify some of my main core values as being
      connection and creativity. Finding a balance between these things along
      side working to keep a roof over my head has been pretty much my life for
      the last 4 years since I graduated high school. I think that I made the
      right decision, and already so many more avenues to further both my
      working career and creative career have presented themselves to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My family has always been creative. Growing up, my mum and dad filmed
      weddings and made short films all the time which was a catalyst for my
      interest in film. I would always try to get involved as much as could, and
      that keenness never really faded. I was lucky to have a very supportive
      and loving family that taught me the value of nurturing and cherishing
      your relationships with the people you love.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I made it to high school I picked up the guitar and found myself
      quickly and comfortably situated with the kids in the music scene. I
      formed a band with a few of my friends, we rehearsed, played gigs and had
      the time of our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope that my creativity will manifest itself as a strength on my
      learning journey, helping me to think of ideas for projects and assist me
      with finding creative solutions to the problems that I face. I also hope
      to create bonds with my classmates and leave this course with new friends
      that I didn’t have before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something that I have struggled with in the past is procrastination. I sit
      here writing this on Saturday, when I promised myself I would have it
      finished on Thursday. I think it’s important to be honest with myself
      about it, instead of letting it manifest and feeling gross about myself
      for my lack of motivation. My ability to battle procrastination is fully
      dependent on my awareness of its existence. In the times where I find
      myself in a bout of productivity and motivation, I need to set foundations
      to make it easier for my future not-so-directed self to cope. Working
      collaboratively helps a lot, I hate to let other people down, which spurs
      me on when there are people relying on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A collaborative confliction that resonates with me most would be in the
      process of writing a song in a band. Things can get pretty heated when you
      have conflicting ideas in a creative project. Its easy to take
      constructive criticism as an insult, and I’ve found myself have many
      fruitless arguments in the past. Something that helped me navigate these
      situations is not taking things personally. Instead, I try to be very
      objective. Give everyone their space to create, and try and find a
      solution that works for everyone. Creative collaboration is inherently
      tough, considering everyone has their own taste and opinion, but there
      will always be a middle ground to settle on.
