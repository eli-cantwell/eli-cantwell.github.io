    <h1>Foundations Reflection</h1>

    <p>
      Throughout foundations, we have been learning how to fine-tune our
      behaviours and mentality to better absorb the information that we’re
      learning. In sprint 1 we learnt about:
    </p>

    <div class="tutorial-code-div">
      <p class="tutorial-code">Thinking like a web developer</p>
      <p class="tutorial-code">Discovering our values and identification</p>
      <p class="tutorial-code">Learning how to introduce ourselves</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      We first learned how to think like a developer. In this primer, we
      researched learning competencies specific to being a developer. This
      including things like understanding exactly what’s being asked for a
      project, planning your approach and breaking it down into small steps.
      Then in the revision phase, you should try to refactor your solution and
      then revise on the whole process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we did some research into our own personal values and identity,
      turning it into a blog about ourselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, in sprint 1, we introduced ourselves to our cohort, telling our
      fellow classmates a little bit about ourselves.
    </p>
    <div class="tutorial-code-div">
      <p class="tutorial-code">Learning Plan</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      In sprint 2 we created a learning plan. This learning plan we included
      what our intentions we’re in terms of a career path, talked about our
      strengths and limitations in terms of learning, what skills we would like
      to see developed at Dev Academy, a commitment to how we would manage our
      workload and how we would seek help if needed, what we expected for the
      facilitators and we were asked to plan ahead for any commitments outside
      of the course.
    </p>
    <div class="tutorial-code-div">
      <p class="tutorial-code">Emotional Intelligence</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      In sprint 3 we learnt about EQ. We learnt that having a high EQ index is
      very beneficial to programming, and specifically useful for working within
      a team. We learnt that having a high IQ isn’t necessarily what employers
      look for in tech, and that your interpersonal relationship skills are much
      more valuable.
    </p>
    <div class="tutorial-code-div">
      <p class="tutorial-code">Neuroplasticity and growth mindset</p>
      <p class="tutorial-code">Listening and Looping</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      In sprint 4 we learnt about our brain and how we can manipulate our
      thought patterns to increase our capacity for learning. We then did some
      listening and looping exercises with our classmates where we called on
      discord and took turns talking about something whilst the other person
      listened without interrupting, and then they would say what they
      interpreted from what you said back to you and vice versa.
    </p>

    <div class="tutorial-code-div">
      <p class="tutorial-code">
        What I’ve learnt from the foundations core learning
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Something that I’ve learnt about myself during these exercises is that I
      don’t particularly like talking about myself, which I don’t think is
      necessarily a bad thing, but it is valuable to understand yourself
      especially in a learning environment so that you can navigate your
      learning weaknesses and play into your learning strengths.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised that Dev Academy took this ‘learn how to learn’ approach,
      and also surprised at how effective it has been, especially in the
      revision aspect. Revising my work each step of the way has significantly
      helped me to retain the learning competencies that I have learnt so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that I was a bit apprehensive at first for some of the blog
      entries because I thought they were a bit pointless, which may have
      stopped me from getting the most out of the exercise. But looking back on
      it now I think that they did help a lot, and maybe I should have been more
      open minded.
