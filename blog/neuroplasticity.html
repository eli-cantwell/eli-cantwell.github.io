    <h1>Mindset</h1>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is the brains ability to form new connections. By
      utilising our brains ability to create new connections and finding ways to
      promote growth, we can more easily create long lasting connections to help
      us improve at a certain task.
    </p>
    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <p>
      For a long time it was believed that after a certain age your brains
      ability to grow and form new connections was relatively fixed, but new
      research has showed that the brain has the ability to expand and form new
      connections long after it physically stops growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding neuroplasticity helps us as learners to realise that our
      brains have an outstanding ability to grow and adapt. By embracing this
      concept, we can approach learning with a sense of optimism, knowing that
      our brains have the ability to form new connections and and learn new
      concepts.
    </p>
    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      The growth mindset is the belief that anyone can learn new skills with
      perseverance and dedication, whereas a fixed mindset is the belief that
      people are born with innate skills that can’t be learnt by others.
    </p>

    <p>
      A growth mindset prioritises putting effort into and embracing challenges,
      cultivating curiosity and embracing feedback. With the belief that we can
      create new skills without the need for innate talent, we can overcome our
      learning prejudices and find our true learning potential
    </p>

    <p>
      In conclusion, Neuroplasticity and the Growth mindset are valuable tools
      that we can use to help promote our personal learning growth.
