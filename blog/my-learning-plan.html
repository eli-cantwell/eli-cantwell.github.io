    <h1>My Learning Plan (Foundations)</h1>

    <p>
      My long term goal after completing this course is to have a job in tech,
      whether that be back-end or something else. I also want to further develop
      my coding skills and start to work on app and game development.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my strengths as a learner is that once I pick something up and
      learn it comprehensively I can find quite creative ways to implement what
      I’ve learnt. One of my flaws when it comes to learning is that I struggle
      with the “just-in-time” learning model. When I don’t understand every
      aspect of what I’m learning, even if it would become clear later, it
      really trips me up and I struggle to move on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like to develop on my collaborative skills. I’ve worked in
      hospitality all my life but I have never really had a job where I was part
      of a team working on a specific project.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have to remind myself to get work done first to free up time later in
      the week for relaxation. This is essential because it’s impossible to tell
      how long something is going to take you, the time boxes are really just an
      indicator. If you end up taking a day off mid-week you can very easily end
      up inundated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its important to let your facilitators and your workmates know if you are
      getting behind on your work, so that they know where you are at and
      possibly give you a hand. If I ever don’t understand a concept or find
      myself behind on work, I will use the Dev Academy discord to either get in
      contact with a facilitator or one of my workmates.
    </p>
    <p>
      My expectations of the facilitation team is to help me to understand
      concepts that I am struggling with and to help me to debug certain
      problems that I can’t figure out how to debug myself.
    </p>
    <h1>My Learning Plan (Bootcamp)</h1>
    <p>
      When I leave dev academy I hope to use what I have learnt to get a job
      within the tech industry and I also hope to start game development as a
      hobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      My biggest strengths in bootcamp will be my ability to work well in
      collaborative projects, but I am worried about not having as much coding
      knowledge as some of my classmates and potentially not being able to
      contribute as much as I would like. This can be fixed with revision and
      practice though.
    </p>
    <p>
      My biggest non-technical challenge in bootcamp will be making sure I stay
      on top of things. This is where it becomes very important for me to plan
      out my week, so they I don’t end up with more work than I had anticipated
      at the end of the week close to the deadline.
    </p>
    <p>
      A non-technical human skill that I would like to see developed at Dev
      Academy is to improve my leadership skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      My expectations of the bootcamp team remains the same as my expectations
      for the foundations team. I hope that my facilitators will give me help
      when I need it, and that they will accomodate for a fun and accepting
      learning environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      My expectations for myself in bootcamp is that I get the work done well in
      advance so that I don’t end up inundated with work, and that I maintain a
      healthy schedule.
