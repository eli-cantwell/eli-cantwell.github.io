    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>

    <p>
      My long term goal after completing this course is to have a job in tech,
      whether that be back-end or something else. I also want to further develop
      my coding skills and start to work on app and game development.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my strengths as a learner is that once I pick something up and
      learn it comprehensively I can find quite creative ways to implement what
      I’ve learnt. One of my flaws when it comes to learning is that I struggle
      with the “just-in-time” learning model. When I don’t understand every
      aspect of what I’m learning, even if it would become clear later, it
      really trips me up and I struggle to move on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like to develop on my collaborative skills. I’ve worked in
      hospitality all my life but I have never really had a job where I was part
      of a team working on a specific project.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have to remind myself to get work done first to free up time later in
      the week for relaxation. This is essential because it’s impossible to tell
      how long something is going to take you, the time boxes are really just an
      indicator. If you end up taking a day off mid-week you can very easily end
      up inundated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its important to let your facilitators and your workmates know if you are
      getting behind on your work, so that they know where you are at and
      possibly give you a hand. If I ever don’t understand a concept or find
      myself behind on work, I will use the Dev Academy discord to either get in
      contact with a facilitator or one of my workmates.
    </p>
    <p>
      My expectations of the facilitation team is to help me to understand
      concepts that I am struggling with and to help me to debug certain
      problems that I can’t figure out how to debug myself.
    </p>
